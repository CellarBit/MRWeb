                <p>Oware is an abstract strategy game among the mancala family of board games (pit and pebble games) played worldwide with slight variations as to the layout of the game,
                number of players and strategy of play. Its origin is uncertain but it is widely believed to be of Ashanti origin.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The board with 12 houses with each player having 6 houses. Players only can grab and move seeds from their own side, and capture only from the opponent side.
                    When clicking in one house the player will grab all seeds from that house and place one at a time in the next houses. 
                    Seeds are captured, by placing the last seed in a house of the oponent territory that has one or two seeds.
                    The aim of the game is to capture 25 seeds, as there are a total of 48 seeds. If each player capture 24 seeds, it's a draw.</p>

                    <img src="boardAbout.png" alt="boardAbout">
                </div>

                <h3>Omitting a house</h3>
                <p>When a house that is being played has more than 11 seeds in it. A seed will be placed in each house normally until reaching the house from those seeds where grab from, 
                    the next seed is not placed in this house but in the one after it.</p>

                <h3>Multiple Capture</h3>
                <p>If one makes a two or three with ones last seed and the house or houses preceding the captured house on the opponents side also have twos, threes or any combination of them,  
                    one captures these as well. So long as there are no houses with less than two or more than three seeds, in-between them, a maximum of five houses can be captured in this way.  
                    Beyond five houses one forfeits everything, as this would leave the opponent with no seeds to play with.</p>

                <h3>Compulsory moves</h3>
                <p>If the situation arises where one player has no seeds to play with the other player must provide some seeds to the opponent if possible. 
                    A move that does not do this whilst being able to feed the other player with seeds is not allowed. Greater priority is placed on capturing seeds to the end. 
                    There for maneuvering seeds in such a way that will eventually lead to the opponent not having no seeds to play with is not encouraged.</p>

                <h3>End game</h3>
                <p>The game ends when one player has captured 25 seeds or more. When both players decide that continuing will only lead to going round in circles in such a case each player keeps the seeds on their side.</p>
