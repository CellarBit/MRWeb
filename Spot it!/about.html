            <p>Spot it! is a game in which players have to find symbols in common between two cards. It was the UK’s best-selling game in 2018 and 2019. 

                The game is sold as Dobble in Europe and Spot It! in the US. The name is a play on the word 'double'. 
                The game uses a deck of 55 cards, each printed with eight different symbols. Any two cards always share one, and only one, matching symbol. <br><br>
                The objective of the game is to be the first player to announce the common symbol between two given cards.
            
                In 1976, inspired by Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, French mathematics enthusiast Jacques Cottereau devised a game consisting of a set of 31 cards each with six images of insects, with exactly one image shared between each pair of them. <br><br>In 2008, journalist and game designer Denis Blanchot found a few of the cards from the "game of insects" and developed the idea to create Dobble.

            <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
            <p>
             In 1 player version. Select the common image in both decks. In 2 player version, each player control 1 deck and choose the repeated image only in their deck, who tpuch it first, who win the round.
            </p>
            <h2>Mathematics</h2>
            <p>The special way that symbols are arranged on Dobble cards can be understood using geometry. If each card is represented by a line, and each symbol by a point where two lines intersect, then the properties of Dobble are that:<br><br>

                any two lines intersect at exactly one point, and<br>
                any two points are joined by exactly one line.<br>
                This geometric structure is an example of a finite projective plane.<br><br><br>
            
                In general, a finite projective plane of order n has n+1 points on each line, and n2+n+1 points and lines.<br><br> This implies that a finite projective plane of order n−1 has n points on each line, and n2−n+1 points and lines.<br><br>
                If there are 3 points in each line this creates a structure known as the Fano plane. This represents a simpler version of Dobble with 3 symbols on each card, 7 cards and 7 symbols.</p>
